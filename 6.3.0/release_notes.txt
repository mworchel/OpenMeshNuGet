OpenMesh 6.3 is still fully backward compatible with the 2.x to 5.x branches. We marked some functions which should not be used anymore as deprecated and added hints which should be used instead. This will be the last release officially supporting C++98 compilers and building the integrated applications with Qt 4. The update adds a workaround for an gcc optimizer bug causing segfaults when optimizing with '-O3'. If your gcc is affected (gcc 4.x and 5.x) OpenMesh will fallback to '-O2'. Our Python interface got some build system updates and we fixed several warnings.
