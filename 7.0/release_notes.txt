This release adds more C++11 support. We can't guarantee that OpenMesh compiles with non C++11 compatible compilers anymore. Furthermore we removed the Python support from the package itself and moved to a new interface available via Pypi.org. The source of the python bindings is now in our Gitlab. Next to the Core updates for C++11 we fixed several bugs and improved handling for external vector types. The Subdivider was updated with a midpoint subdivision scheme. Another set of changes adds fixes and improvements to several reader and writer modules.
